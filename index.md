Sample projects for React and TypeScript
========================================

First things first: in order to create a new project using React and
TypeScript, please follow [this guide](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter#typescript-react-starter),
which will guide you through the laborous 3 or 4 commands to creating such
projects. Please make some coffee while creating any project with such instructions
because it takes a while to get ready.

In this repository, we have the following samples and tutorials:

- [GitHub pages deploy](./github-pages-deploy): if you want to make your own set of samples and host them
  in GitHub pages, this page will guide you on how to do that.
- [calculator](./calculator/): a very very simple calculator, which shows the basics from React.
